# Digital Signal Processor

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is an initial sketch of code for a _Raspberry Pi Pico_. It uses a PIO to output I2S. 

A lot more work needs to be done:
* I2S output with correct frequencies
* I2S input
* Volume control
* Low and high pass filters (using Biquads).

It has been  dervied from the [rp2040-project-template](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp2040-project-template). Instructions for installing the toolchain and running are shown there.
